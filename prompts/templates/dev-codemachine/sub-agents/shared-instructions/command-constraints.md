#### **Command Usage Constraints**

Do NOT use exploratory or planning commands or use listing commands (`ls`, `la`, `ll`, `dir`) except:
1. When explicitly instructed by your protocol
2. Before escalating critical errors for diagnostic information

**Rationale:** Minimize unnecessary output and token consumption. Focus on execution, not exploration.
