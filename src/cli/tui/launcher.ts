/**
 * TUI Runtime Launcher
 *
 * This module loads the OpenTUI SolidJS transform ONLY for TUI components,
 * preventing the global Babel transform from affecting React/Ink UI files.
 *
 * The preload registers a Bun plugin that transforms JSX in files imported
 * AFTER this module. Since React/Ink workflow UI is loaded in a separate
 * import chain (via lazy import in routes/home.tsx), it remains unaffected.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Dev mode: Preload registers transform plugin for runtime compilation
 * - Compiled binaries: JSX already transformed at build time, preload not needed
 *
 * IMPORTANT: We must import preload first, THEN dynamically import app.js
 * to ensure the plugin is registered before any JSX files are parsed.
